				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Want to increase your sales on your website? 10 years ago we used a normal phone which has a button for communication purposes. These days most people are using <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/">mobile phones in India</a>. As a <strong><a href="https://www.webkites.in/web-development-company-in-chennai">web development company in Chennai</a></strong>, we solved many problems for business people to reach their customers online. When you complete this article it will help you to decide what type of chatbot is useful for your business.</p>
<h2>
<p dir="ltr">1) Button focused Chatbot</p>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the olden days, we used mobile phones which had buttons for voice calling and messaging purposes. If we want to ask any questions about the product or service from brands. They used an Interactive<a href="https://www.airtel.in/business/b2b/airtel-iq"> voice response (IVR) </a> System for solving customer problems. Nowadays It was transferred to chatbot which will show our website menus as option tour customers. If a customer chooses any of the menus in chat, we will set a response for those menus. It is called button focused chatbot. Once you get 100 or 1000 visitors to your website on a daily basis you can make a decision to choose a button-focused chatbot.</p>
<h2>
<p dir="ltr">2) Keyword Recognition focused Chatbot</p>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I visited a supermarket that has more variety of grocery products. I asked one salesperson where potatoes are for sale. He guided me to which row and rack stored vegetables. Here “potato” is a word that recognizes the human and replies relevant to that rack. When it comes to the computer, it recognizes the keyword and replies to the relevant webpage link to your customer. Once your website gets 100 to 1000 returning visitors to your website on a daily basis you can make a decision to keyword recognition-focused chatbot.</p>
<h2>
<p dir="ltr">3) Conversion focused Chatbot</p>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">One month ago I bought groceries for my home with my wife&#8217;s grocery list in a nearby grocery shop. This month, I went to the same shop to buy groceries and used the same grocery list. Finally, it saved more time to get my groceries home. When it comes to the website, you need to ask the question “Can I repeat your old order which you made for the previous month? “. If they replied “yes”, We can proceed with your order for the existing customer. Once your website gets 100 to 1000 conversion which means sales of your products or service to your website on a daily basis you can make the decision to Conversion focused Chatbot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I hope you have understood the different types of chatbots for business. Now you can make a decision about which type of Chatbot suits your business. We explained the different situations of chatbot based on our research. Finally, If you are interested in sharing your example, you can feel free to ask your example and doubts about our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/webkites">social media</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Want to know the top reasons for your online Ads not visible to your target customers? Here we will discuss]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Want to know the top reasons for your online Ads not visible to your target customers? Here we will discuss the reasons not visible to customers in a simple way. As a <a href="https://www.webkites.in/web-designing-company-in-chennai">web designing company in Chennai</a>, we have good experience in making online ads for our clients. If you take an online ad it is mostly visible on <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">search engines</a> or <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/social-media-stats">social media</a> based on user demographics, user behaviors, and interest.</p>
<h2>1. Less Budget</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The budget will come in two situations for online ads. Initially, Before creating a campaign we need to set a budget in our business account level. After that, We need to set a budget for a specific month or week campaign. The campaign budget will deduct from the account level. The daily budget will be deducted from the campaign level based on customer clicks. For Example) If you set a daily budget Rs 300 and cost per click Rs 10, then a maximum 30 clicks only done by your customer. After that, your customer can’t see your ad because of less budget in your daily budget.</p>
<h2>2. Location</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Every business has customers, they are located anywhere in the world. Any Online Ad Platform gives the option for targeting your customers geographically. They also provide targeting option with a specific radius of kilometers which is more helpful for local business. . For Example ) if you target your ad visibility within a 20km radius from your location, your customer should see your ad within a 20km radius location. If your customer searches for your product or service apart from a 20km radius, your customers can&#8217;t see your ad.</p>
<h2>3. Schedule</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Every business has its own business hours. Many online ad platforms provide dates but some platforms provide specific schedules based on shop opening time and closing time. If you are setting a campaign, you must set a scheduled end date based on your campaign budget. In our company, we executed one campaign for local businesses based on shopping working hours. If anyone searches for a product apart from working hours, your customers can’t see your ad.</p>
<h2>4. Status</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While executing your campaign for your business, it will be reviewed from an online ad platform. If you <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942?hl=en">violating the policy</a> of an online ad platform, your campaign will be rejected from the online platform. Finally, your customers can’t see your ad. If your ad is successfully approved, your campaign status will be active. As an Advertiser, you can control your campaign from online ad platforms. If you change your campaign status “Active” to “Pause“ mode, your customers can’t see your ad.</p>
<p>I hope you all understand the reasons behind online ads that are not visible to your customers. If you resolve your problems with your online advertising campaigns, you can share this article with your friends on social media or SMS. The above 4 reasons are the very basic level for a checklist for your online advertisement. If you have any doubts in your online advertisement, you can easily reach out by mail id <a href="mailto:support@webkites.in.We">support@webkites.in.We</a> are happy to solve your problem with our knowledge.</p>

Once you know about a customer you have to collect information about customer behavior, demographics, and interests in your mind. For Example ) If you want to know people&#8217;s interest on google, you can check <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/trendingsearches/daily?geo=IN">google trends</a> with the demographic locations.</p>
<h2>Apply your Design</h2>
<p>Now you recollect that customer information and take action with your design tools like photoshop, illustrator, and much more.

To know more about design principles check the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-principles">standard designer community</a>.</p>
<h2>After your Design</h2>

Due to internet penetration, you have to go with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnichannel">omnichannel</a> approach for your business. For Example) If your customers are using an android phone they will surely use the play store. Now you can check the play store which app is trending and relevant to your customers. Generally, Social media Apps are trending all over the world. If you want you can check different social media banners dimensions from <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-image-sizes-guide/">social media research insight</a> using social media tools..</p>
<h2>Start Spreading</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I hope you are well cleared about online banners. Hereafter you can make your own decision for your organization or company brand to the people online.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Real World connected over the Internet for communication and commercial purpose.Do you know the difference and importance between http vs https ? .I have been working at a <a title="Web Designing Company in Chennai" href="https://www.webkites.in/web-designing-company-in-chennai" target="_blank"><strong>web designing company in chennai</strong> </a>for the past 10 years . I will help you to make understanding for you. Both are Protocols which means a set of rules and regulations of transmitting data between electronic devices.</p>
<h2>How HTTP Works ?</h2>
<div id="attachment_748" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-example-website-image.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-748" alt="http example website image" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-example-website-image.png" width="500" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Example look of http Website</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">HTTP stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>.All your requests are easily traceable by hackers. Arun kumar is Retail Business owner. He wants a website so he requests <a href="https://www.webkites.in/contact-us">http://www.webkites.in/contact-us</a>  from the <a href="https://www.google.com/">search engine</a>  . Now the response will come from an unsecured registered server.In between responses anyone <strong>can steal information</strong> of arun kumar.</p>
<h2>How HTTPS Works ?</h2>
<div id="attachment_751" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-example-webiste-image1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-751" alt="https example webiste image" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-example-webiste-image1.png" width="500" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Example Look of HTTPS Website</p></div>
<p>HTTPS stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Secured Socket Layer</a></strong>. All your information is not traceable by hackers . If Arun kumar requests <a href="https://www.webkites.in/contact-us">https://www.webkites.in/contact-us</a> from <a href="https://www.google.com/">search engine</a> . In between anyone <strong>can’t steal information</strong> of arun kumar. It is more useful for arun kumar retail business and website development company owner.</p>
<h2>How to check your website having HTTP or HTTPS ?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-to-check-my-website-is-having-http-or-https.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-747" alt="how to check my website is having http or https" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-to-check-my-website-is-having-http-or-https.png" width="690" height="191" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">STEP 1 : Wait for Loading your Complete Website<br />
STEP 2 : Now you have copy your Address bar which is available at the top of the browser.<br />
STEP 3: Paste it on a Separate Notepad File .<br />
STEP 4: Now you can see Complete URL</p>
<p>Great I hope you understood the difference between http vs https. Here after when you search on google make sure that website is secured or not.If you have any doubts comment below we will answer quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>KEYWORDS</b></p>
<p><b>     </b>Keywords in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) are the ideas or phrases which define what the content is all about. They are the shortcuts which summarize the entire article. Keywords help Search engines like Google to search for appropriate queries.</p>
<p><b>WHY KEYWORD RESEARCH IMPORTANT FOR SEO</b></p>
<p>Keyword Research is a process to identify popular phrases or words which people frequently search using search engines.  Researching the keywords will help content writers or marketers to understand better to create optimized SEO content. It is one of the important SEO factors that improve the rank of Google and also adds value to the website.</p>
<p><b>1.    KEYWORDS ACT AS HINTS</b></p>
<p>Keywords have the power to express both explicit and implicit information. For example, the keyword “safest car” has explicit information stating “safety concern” as well as implicit information stating “who owns a car for the first time”. Researching such powerful keywords and implementing the content will add value to the blogs. To start with the keyword research it should include the idea, topic or head keyword which is also called “seed”. The seed comes from the respective industrial knowledge related to the products or the services we provide. This seed increases the search volume as well as it will be helpful to find more related keyword suggestions.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>2.    TO CREATE AN OPTIMIZED CONTENT</b></p>
<p><b>    </b>Search engines like Google will be changing its search algorithm multiple times a year. Maintaining the SEO strategy regularly will always keep our blog in top searches ahead of the competitors. Change of keywords is also important in content optimization to meet the current demands. While changing the keywords, it is important to follow the SEO best practice to change the Meta description and subtitles that match with the updated content. Search Engines always looks for consistency in the entire content. Such Keyword Research practices will enhance the visibility of the SEO content as well it helps in creating an optimized SEO content</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>3.    PROMOTION OF BRANDS OR SERVICES</b></p>
<p>Performing the separate Keyword search in specific, under different categories of particular brands or products will lead to higher chance of attracting the targeted client leads who look for the exact kind of products listed under the particular category.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>4.    TARGETS CUSTOMER</b></p>
<p><b>     </b>The important factor of keyword research involves understanding the audience and the queries they ask, to answer them effectively related to the content with a combination of phrases and keywords.  Effective keyword research will automatically satisfy the customer requirements related to the particular product or services thus meeting their demands on time.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>5.    SITE ARCHITECTURE</b></p>
<p><b>     </b>When a website needs to be redesigned, keyword research helps in editing the existing site architecture also recreating the new website by copywriting. Generally, the site architecture is built only after the first round of keyword research is performed.</p>
<p>Keyword Research plays a vital role that helps in streamlining Search Engine Optimization (SEO) campaign and also brings the targeted users to visit frequently which in turn produces profitable results. A proper Keyword research will result in a successful Internet campaign.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)</b></p>
<p><b>            </b>Search Engine Optimization is an analytical, technical and creative process to increase the online visibility of a website through search engine results. It is a process of optimizing a website where users can easily search through search engines. To start with the SEO content we need to create an outline first based on our understanding of the article.</p>
<p><b> HOW TO WRITE AN SEO OPTIMIZED CONTENT</b></p>
<p><b>1.    KEYWORD RESEARCH</b></p>
<p>For better SEO content, we need to understand which keywords to be used in the Google search to see what kind of contents are currently in ranking. Keywords which are searched frequently will drive towards the competition for the premium position. It is always best to do research on keywords before the content is written.</p>
<p><b>2.     TECHNICAL NEEDS</b></p>
<p>To create optimized content, knowing a few things technically about how search engines like Google handle the pages will assist in building a strategy. A good understanding of how a blog should be structured will be more efficient in creating an optimized content.</p>
<p><b>3.    CONTENT-LENGTH</b></p>
<p><b>                 </b>Generally, longer content and articles are preferred by search engines, so that users can search easily. Longer content adds more value to the customers and also increases visibility.</p>
<p><b>4.    CHOOSING TITLE </b></p>
<p><b>            </b>The Title plays an important role in content.   Choosing the appropriate title related to the content is also an important factor to consider when a user searches using the search engine.</p>
<p><b>5.    ADDING LINKS</b></p>
<p>The Inclusion of External and Internal links adds more value to the content. Internal links refer to a post within the article and External links refer to a post outside the article referring to the authority websites like CNN, Wikipedia which helps the users to explore more on the particular topic which will create a positive impact to the users. Also, the URL of the content should have a focused keyword which will look more professional and likely to be shared more on the social media channels.</p>
<p><b>6.    VISUAL CONTENTS</b></p>
<p>Including images and videos will further attract the users and also the time spent by the users will also be increased on the site.</p>
<p><b> 7.    ADDING META DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>Meta Description is a quick summary of the article that is included below the title. Adding a Meta Description to the content helps the users to grasp easily about what the content is all about.</p>
<p><b> 8.    SOCIAL SHARING BUTTONS</b></p>
<p>Use of social sharing buttons provides users a platform to share our content thus increasing the brand exposure as well as improving the user experience.</p>
<p><b> 9.    MOBILE-FRIENDLY</b></p>
<p><b> </b>   Since Mobile marketing is growing rapidly all over the world, blogs created should be useful for mobile users as well which will serve for future needs.</p>
<p>The main focus of the SEO content should be more informative and attractive which will be optimized for search as well as conversions and the next focus should be targeted towards the blog content which demonstrates how to use products and providing links relevant to the posts will automatically drive the users to spend more time in the blog.</p>
