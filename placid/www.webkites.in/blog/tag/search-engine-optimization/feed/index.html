				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)</b></p>
<p><b>            </b>Search Engine Optimization is an analytical, technical and creative process to increase the online visibility of a website through search engine results. It is a process of optimizing a website where users can easily search through search engines. To start with the SEO content we need to create an outline first based on our understanding of the article.</p>
<p><b> HOW TO WRITE AN SEO OPTIMIZED CONTENT</b></p>
<p><b>1.    KEYWORD RESEARCH</b></p>
<p>For better SEO content, we need to understand which keywords to be used in the Google search to see what kind of contents are currently in ranking. Keywords which are searched frequently will drive towards the competition for the premium position. It is always best to do research on keywords before the content is written.</p>
<p><b>2.     TECHNICAL NEEDS</b></p>
<p>To create optimized content, knowing a few things technically about how search engines like Google handle the pages will assist in building a strategy. A good understanding of how a blog should be structured will be more efficient in creating an optimized content.</p>
<p><b>3.    CONTENT-LENGTH</b></p>
<p><b>                 </b>Generally, longer content and articles are preferred by search engines, so that users can search easily. Longer content adds more value to the customers and also increases visibility.</p>
<p><b>4.    CHOOSING TITLE </b></p>
<p><b>            </b>The Title plays an important role in content.   Choosing the appropriate title related to the content is also an important factor to consider when a user searches using the search engine.</p>
<p><b>5.    ADDING LINKS</b></p>
<p>The Inclusion of External and Internal links adds more value to the content. Internal links refer to a post within the article and External links refer to a post outside the article referring to the authority websites like CNN, Wikipedia which helps the users to explore more on the particular topic which will create a positive impact to the users. Also, the URL of the content should have a focused keyword which will look more professional and likely to be shared more on the social media channels.</p>
<p><b>6.    VISUAL CONTENTS</b></p>
<p>Including images and videos will further attract the users and also the time spent by the users will also be increased on the site.</p>
<p><b> 7.    ADDING META DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>Meta Description is a quick summary of the article that is included below the title. Adding a Meta Description to the content helps the users to grasp easily about what the content is all about.</p>
<p><b> 8.    SOCIAL SHARING BUTTONS</b></p>
<p>Use of social sharing buttons provides users a platform to share our content thus increasing the brand exposure as well as improving the user experience.</p>
<p><b> 9.    MOBILE-FRIENDLY</b></p>
<p><b> </b>   Since Mobile marketing is growing rapidly all over the world, blogs created should be useful for mobile users as well which will serve for future needs.</p>
<p>The main focus of the SEO content should be more informative and attractive which will be optimized for search as well as conversions and the next focus should be targeted towards the blog content which demonstrates how to use products and providing links relevant to the posts will automatically drive the users to spend more time in the blog.</p>
