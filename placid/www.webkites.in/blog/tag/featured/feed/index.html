		<description><![CDATA[Facebook Remarketing: Facebook Remarketing is the one way of reconnecting with Facebook users those who have already visited your website]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Facebook Remarketing:</b></p>
<p>Facebook Remarketing is the one way of reconnecting with Facebook users those who have already visited your website page. This will be done by installing a pixel on your webpages, which sends information back to Facebook.</p>
<p>If the user is signed in, their account is logged and is then eligible for retargeting campaigns. You should setup the custom audiences to capture the users and set a goal for them to complete like click your phone number, for instance.</p>
<p>Those who don’t complete the goal are added to the custom audience list. It have auto-remove visitors those who have completed the goal. So, that easily you can target those users by creating simple demographics and relevant content.</p>
<p>It allows you to interact with people who have previously visited key pages on your website and offers them a new efficient way to coincide the right people with the right message.</p>
<p>Some of the Facebook Remarketing practices are,</p>
<p><b>Expand the market reach:</b></p>
<p>Expanding the target to those individuals who share characteristics with your potential and existing customers. You can do this by creating a custom audience list which includes people who have visited a particular page on your website.</p>
<p>The advantage of this method is to reach potential new customers that you were missing out on and who are interested in your product or services might convert into buyers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/expand-market-reach.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-644" alt="expand-market-reach" src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/expand-market-reach.jpg" width="480" height="312" /></a></p>
<p><b>Lower Cost per Click:</b></p>
<p>When compared to remarketing on search engines than its lower cost on remarketing in Facebook per click. Because the lower cost is that Facebook traffic is less targeted than the search engine traffic. The Search engines normally work around pull marketing since the people has searched for your product to start with, but Facebook exposes new potential clients to your product (push marketing) since, really, Facebook users aren’t searching for your product or service right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/low-cost-per-click.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-645" alt="low-cost-per-click" src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/low-cost-per-click.jpg" width="480" height="342" /></a></p>
<p><b>Drive Higher Conversions:</b></p>
<p>It takes time to converting a first time visitors in to buyers. If your industry is competitive, users can browse multiple websites before they complete a purchase. Once they left your website, they can forget your name and you might be lost your sale. To avoid this, remarketing to website visitors, who left your website and again they see you on Facebook will be more recognizable and efficient to boosts your chances of them converting.</p>
<p>You can exclude users those who have completed a sale by simply creating a custom remarketing segment for users who visited your thank you page and then preventing them from seeing your campaign.</p>
<p><b>Social Proof:</b></p>
<p>When a person who purchases your products or uses your services and they think that a good experience then, they recommend your brand or business. It’s not about to limit your remarketing only to potential customers. Displaying ads to those who have already purchase from you, allows current customers to interact with potential customers.</p>
<p>Happy customers always share positive comments and engage with your content. This can improve positive impression of your brand and might have increases the conversions, also increases brand loyalty.</p>
<p>This can leads to generate more engagement and conversions among potential or existing customers.</p>
<p><b>Mailing List Integration:</b></p>
<p>You can remarketing through mailing lists. You have to create a custom audience and import the mailing list. After that Facebook matches it up with the profile attached to the email. This way you can market to users even those who not known you have a Facebook page.</p>
<p>Please mail to <a href="file:///C:/Users/Acer/Google%20Drive/suji/suji%201/seo%20files/blog/support@webkites.in%20">support@webkites.in</a> or contact us through <a href="file:///C:/Users/Acer/Google%20Drive/suji/suji%201/seo%20files/blog/www.webkites.in">www.webkites.in</a> to rank your website top in Google.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>What is Instagram?</b></p>
<p>Instagram is a Social networking website to share photos and videos from a desktop or smart phones. It is similar to Facebook or twitter, everyone who creates an Instagram account has a profile and news feed. When you post a video or photo on Instagram, it will be shown on your profile. It can able to see by followers of you and you can able to see photos and videos of others whom you followed on Instagram.</p>
<p>There are many ways to get Instagram followers and the likes, in that some of the tips I would like to share. Some of them are,</p>
<p><b>Make use of Captions</b></p>
<p>Captions are the one plays an important role in the increased engagement. So that helps you get more Instagram followers. Here are few methods to keep in mind.</p>
<p><b>Use most important words up front:</b></p>
<p>Captions in user feed cut off after some lines of text, so that put important words on the top.</p>
<p><b>Ask a question:</b></p>
<p>This helps your audience to leave a comment with their answer. This engagement leads you to visible your account too many people.</p>
<p><b>Emoji:</b></p>
<p>It can help to make attention to the reader’s eye in the highly visual social network.</p>
<p><b>Try different caption Lengths:</b></p>
<p>Use long-form captions and short-form captions to post.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/instagram.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-628" alt="instagram" src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/instagram.jpg" width="766" height="496" /></a></p>
<p><b>Like more People photos</b></p>
<p>To become popular in Instagram, all you need to do is make people see your posts. The easiest way is to like people stuff but doesn&#8217;t randomly like everything you see. Like the people stuff who you want to follows you.</p>
<p><b>Post regularly and at the right time</b></p>
<p>Analysis by Tailwind noted that “by posting to Instagram daily will grow followers four times faster than posting less than once a week”. So post daily at the right time. The best time is to post in the morning, lunch time or after work in the Monday to Friday basis. Most of the people don’t active in Instagram during working hours. According to your customers, active time post your content in that time.</p>
<p><b>Have a great bio and profile</b></p>
<p>Your profile is the backbone of your presence on Instagram. And one of the keys to increasing your followers. Who will click the follow button a profile that’s unclear, incomplete?</p>
<p>Your profile is made up of the name, username, website ad bio.</p>
<p><b>Name:</b></p>
<p>Up to 30 characters, and included in the Instagram search, so you may wish to include a keyword.</p>
<p><b>Username:</b></p>
<p>Make it consistent with your username on other social network channels to make it easy for followers on other platforms to find you on Instagram.</p>
<p><b>Website:</b></p>
<p>Here the place you can add a clickable link.</p>
<p><b>Bio:</b></p>
<p>Here, you can tell about you or else about your brand identity up to 150 characters and show new visitors why they should follow you.</p>
<p><b>Stick to a Schedule</b></p>
<p>It’s very important that your followers know when to expect a post from you. If you are active daily on Instagram then, post daily. Your audience will expect that regular post.</p>
<p>Update your account daily or otherwise, it will disappear for weeks.</p>
<p><b>Don’t be boring</b></p>
<p>If people are coming to your account for your photos then, Post what people like you but don’t post the same thing like sunsets, natures over and over. Post variety of photos what they like.</p>
<p><b>Use interesting Hash Tags</b></p>
<p>Hash tags are the ultimate one to get more views for your posts. So use attractive and interesting hash tags for your post.</p>
<p><b>Interact with your Audience</b></p>
<p>Comment to your audience posts likes a photo of them and respond to the commenters.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Targeting many keywords within a single page, that page should rank in a search engine is not an easy thing]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Targeting many keywords within a single page, that page should rank in a search engine is not an easy thing until we proceed with SEO friendly strategies. Yeah, but we can make it possible to rank many keywords on a single page by using SEO friendly strategies.</p>
<p>Let us discuss the How to rank for many Keywords within a single page,</p>
<p>The First thing is to go to Google AdWords, click on tools analysis and then click on keyword planner. Then click on search for keyword and ad group ideas and put your specific multiple keywords into this box. Select high search volume keywords according to your page. And then start to optimize your page by using these keywords which you had found. After, incorporate all these keywords into your title tag without over optimizing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Google-Keyword-Planner1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-621" alt="google-keyword-planner" src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Google-Keyword-Planner1.jpg" width="500" height="312" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mistake lot of people do is that, when they targeting multiple keywords for the single page, they use to do like this very, very common. It’s include repeat and repeated again, it’s not only bad for SEO but also it gives very low click through rate. So, include all keywords in the same title without over optimizing.</p>
<p>Next prepare for a description tag, which should include what people search for the query which related to your targeting keywords so, they can click through to this Meta description to your page. The Meta description should contain all of the keywords that you are targeting.</p>
<p>Next switch to the content of the page, in that, include your targeted keywords and make a content. Highlight all of your targeted keywords and use H<sub>2</sub> tags in the content paragraphs that is very important because Google concentrates on more at H<sub>2</sub> tags content in the paragraph tag.</p>
<p>These will form the subheadings for the paragraph and prepare the subheadings by using what, why, how like these words. And write the content which explains about the keywords. In that, you will include subheadings, right? As you write. Include some of the keywords into the content without over optimizing.</p>
<p>Now coming to the conclusion, you can target your multiple keywords on a single page and optimize your page as I discussed above. Optimization is great, as it will build the page&#8217;s rankings, while over-optimization is awful, as it can produce precisely the opposite results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google has announced some changes in its AdSense’s policy. It can more transparency for publishers and site owners. Previously, Google will terminate the user AdSense account immediately if anything violates the Google’s AdSense policy. This will be a major loss for the publishers who depends on AdSense income only.</p>
<p>Now according to the Google new AdSense policy, Google will terminate ads only from the specific page that violates the Google AdSense rules. This new change will be a great support for the publishers and site owners who mostly depends on the AdSense income only. This new policy will definitely reduce the risk for the AdSense Publisher.</p>
<p><b>Taking action at the level:</b></p>
<p>The Google new technology is enabled across all AdSense policies as of today. Instead of removing ads from publisher’s entire website, it turned off ads at the page level. The Google will take the action faster with site penalties. It will wait until a certain number of pages are in violation before taking action. However, according to page-level violations, it will act immediately.</p>
<p><b>New Policy Centre in AdSense:</b></p>
<p>According to new AdSense Policy, when a page is found in violation, the Google AdSense Policy team will send a mail to the Publishers about the ads by informing something like “We have found that your ads don’t meet our AdSense policies.”</p>
<p>The first thing, Google says will serve as a one-stop shop for everything publishers can know easily about the policy actions. In the new policy center section, the publishers will be able to view details on any page-level or website-level. Viewing on a page-level will show full details about what policy is violated and the current status. So, that Publishers can know about the problems and able to know how to resolve and send a request to review the page. For AdSense team, to review the page it will take hardly one week to complete. Publishers also can able to remove the ad code from that particular page.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/google-adsense.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-613" alt="google-adsense" src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/google-adsense.png" width="415" height="311" /></a></p>
<p>The Second Change is Google announced that, its move from site-level to page-level policy actions. Until now, the default action taken by the Google when a violation of against AdSense policies was found. Those websites will completely disable ads site-wide. This is not much popular with Publishers or owners that Google making ads disable from those websites who meets against AdSense policies through page-level policy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good Website Performance is the most important factor to improve our website ranking on search engines.</p>
<p>Let us, discuss some of the tips to increase website Performance to improve SEO rankings, are as follows.</p>
<p><b>Image Optimization:</b></p>
<p>You need to focus on three things,</p>
<p>1.    Image size</p>
<p>2.    Format and</p>
<p>3.    Src attribute</p>
<p><b>Image Size</b></p>
<p>Use correct image Size</p>
<p><b>Image Format</b></p>
<p>JPEG, PNG, GIFs</p>
<p>JPEG &#8211; best Option</p>
<p>PNG &#8211; Good, but some old browsers may not fully support it.</p>
<p>GIFs &#8211; Use for small or simple graphics and animated images.</p>
<p>Avoid using BMPs or TIFFS.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image-optimization.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-601" alt="Image Optimization" src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/image-optimization.jpg" width="418" height="321" /></a></p>
<p><b>SRC attribute</b></p>
<p>Avoid blank image src codes. In HTML, the code of an image includes,</p>
<p><b>&lt;img src=””&gt;</b></p>
<p>When there is blank in the quotation marks, the web browser accepts the request to the directory of the page or to the current page itself.</p>
<p>It leads to unnecessary traffic to your web servers and can corrupt data’s.</p>
<p><b>Reduce HTTP requests</b></p>
<p>One of the main factors of improving website performance is to reduce the number of round trips i.e., the browser needs to make to the server. Whatever your website files have like CSS, JavaScript or images those needed to be downloaded to the browser. By making this factor your website speed performance will increase.</p>
<p>If you add separate CSS files for various sections of your website then you will recognize it gainful to have all the CSS in one stylesheet, same as for JavaScript and other resources.</p>
<p>Include your CSS like this,</p>
<p>@import url(&#8216;myCss.css&#8217;);</p>
<p>After reconsider and use,</p>
<p>&lt;link rel=&#8217;stylesheet&#8217; href=&#8217;myCSS.css&#8217;&gt;</p>
<p>By making this, resulting in faster page load times.</p>
<p><b>Minifying HTML, CSS and JS:</b></p>
<p>Remove unnecessary Characters from your HTML, CSS and from JavaScript, like as;</p>
<p>1.    Block delimiters</p>
<p>2.    Comments</p>
<p>3.    New line characters and</p>
<p>4.    White space characters</p>
<p>This would result in the speed up your load times and it can reduce your amount of code i.e.; requested from the server.</p>
<p><b>Avoid redirects:</b></p>
<p>Try to avoid redirects on your website, redirects creates additional HTTP requests and increase load time.</p>
<p><b>Enable Cache:</b></p>
<p>Enable cache on your website to reduce bandwidth and improve website performance. Both web servers and web browsers allow caching. Cache is a temporary storage of web pages. This saves time on servers and makes faster.</p>
<p><b>Serve scaled images:</b></p>
<p>Always upload your images at a scale not rely on CSS to reduce the size of them.</p>
<p><b>Content Delivery Network:</b></p>
<p>Keep your media files in the content delivery network is one of the best ways to speed up your website. It can save up to 60% bandwidth and it delivers them through web servers to the nearest user’s location. It increases the faster load time of the website.</p>
<p><b>Reduce Plugins:</b></p>
<p>Reduce the unnecessary plugins on your website.</p>
<p><b>Hotlink Protection:</b></p>
<p>It is used to protecting your website images will displaying on another website. Which means restricting HTTP referrers from embedding your assets on other websites.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<p>Place this code in your .htaccess file:</p>
<p>RewriteEngine On</p>
<p>RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(.+\.)?domain\.com/ [NC]
<p>RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$</p>
<p>RewriteRule .*\.(jpe?g|gif|bmp|png)$ http://i.imgur.com/donotsteal.gif [L]
