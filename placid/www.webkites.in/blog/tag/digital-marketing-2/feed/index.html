				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Want to know the top reasons for your online Ads not visible to your target customers? Here we will discuss the reasons not visible to customers in a simple way. As a <a href="https://www.webkites.in/web-designing-company-in-chennai">web designing company in Chennai</a>, we have good experience in making online ads for our clients. If you take an online ad it is mostly visible on <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">search engines</a> or <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/social-media-stats">social media</a> based on user demographics, user behaviors, and interest.</p>
<h2>1. Less Budget</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The budget will come in two situations for online ads. Initially, Before creating a campaign we need to set a budget in our business account level. After that, We need to set a budget for a specific month or week campaign. The campaign budget will deduct from the account level. The daily budget will be deducted from the campaign level based on customer clicks. For Example) If you set a daily budget Rs 300 and cost per click Rs 10, then a maximum 30 clicks only done by your customer. After that, your customer can’t see your ad because of less budget in your daily budget.</p>
<h2>2. Location</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Every business has customers, they are located anywhere in the world. Any Online Ad Platform gives the option for targeting your customers geographically. They also provide targeting option with a specific radius of kilometers which is more helpful for local business. . For Example ) if you target your ad visibility within a 20km radius from your location, your customer should see your ad within a 20km radius location. If your customer searches for your product or service apart from a 20km radius, your customers can&#8217;t see your ad.</p>
<h2>3. Schedule</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Every business has its own business hours. Many online ad platforms provide dates but some platforms provide specific schedules based on shop opening time and closing time. If you are setting a campaign, you must set a scheduled end date based on your campaign budget. In our company, we executed one campaign for local businesses based on shopping working hours. If anyone searches for a product apart from working hours, your customers can’t see your ad.</p>
<h2>4. Status</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While executing your campaign for your business, it will be reviewed from an online ad platform. If you <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942?hl=en">violating the policy</a> of an online ad platform, your campaign will be rejected from the online platform. Finally, your customers can’t see your ad. If your ad is successfully approved, your campaign status will be active. As an Advertiser, you can control your campaign from online ad platforms. If you change your campaign status “Active” to “Pause“ mode, your customers can’t see your ad.</p>
<p>I hope you all understand the reasons behind online ads that are not visible to your customers. If you resolve your problems with your online advertising campaigns, you can share this article with your friends on social media or SMS.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>KEYWORDS</b></p>
<p><b>     </b>Keywords in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) are the ideas or phrases which define what the content is all about. They are the shortcuts which summarize the entire article. Keywords help Search engines like Google to search for appropriate queries.</p>

<p><b>1.    KEYWORDS ACT AS HINTS</b></p>
<p>Keywords have the power to express both explicit and implicit information. For example, the keyword “safest car” has explicit information stating “safety concern” as well as implicit information stating “who owns a car for the first time”. Researching such powerful keywords and implementing the content will add value to the blogs. To start with the keyword research it should include the idea, topic or head keyword which is also called “seed”. The seed comes from the respective industrial knowledge related to the products or the services we provide. This seed increases the search volume as well as it will be helpful to find more related keyword suggestions.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>2.    TO CREATE AN OPTIMIZED CONTENT</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)</b></p>
<p><b>            </b>Search Engine Optimization is an analytical, technical and creative process to increase the online visibility of a website through search engine results. It is a process of optimizing a website where users can easily search through search engines. To start with the SEO content we need to create an outline first based on our understanding of the article.</p>
<p><b> HOW TO WRITE AN SEO OPTIMIZED CONTENT</b></p>
<p><b>1.    KEYWORD RESEARCH</b></p>
<p>For better SEO content, we need to understand which keywords to be used in the Google search to see what kind of contents are currently in ranking. Keywords which are searched frequently will drive towards the competition for the premium position. It is always best to do research on keywords before the content is written.</p>
<p><b>2.     TECHNICAL NEEDS</b></p>
<p>To create optimized content, knowing a few things technically about how search engines like Google handle the pages will assist in building a strategy. A good understanding of how a blog should be structured will be more efficient in creating an optimized content.</p>
<p><b>3.    CONTENT-LENGTH</b></p>
<p><b>                 </b>Generally, longer content and articles are preferred by search engines, so that users can search easily. Longer content adds more value to the customers and also increases visibility.</p>
<p><b>4.    CHOOSING TITLE </b></p>
<p><b>            </b>The Title plays an important role in content.   Choosing the appropriate title related to the content is also an important factor to consider when a user searches using the search engine.</p>
<p><b>5.    ADDING LINKS</b></p>
<p>The Inclusion of External and Internal links adds more value to the content. Internal links refer to a post within the article and External links refer to a post outside the article referring to the authority websites like CNN, Wikipedia which helps the users to explore more on the particular topic which will create a positive impact to the users. Also, the URL of the content should have a focused keyword which will look more professional and likely to be shared more on the social media channels.</p>
<p><b>6.    VISUAL CONTENTS</b></p>
<p>Including images and videos will further attract the users and also the time spent by the users will also be increased on the site.</p>
<p><b> 7.    ADDING META DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>Meta Description is a quick summary of the article that is included below the title. Adding a Meta Description to the content helps the users to grasp easily about what the content is all about.</p>
<p><b> 8.    SOCIAL SHARING BUTTONS</b></p>
<p>Use of social sharing buttons provides users a platform to share our content thus increasing the brand exposure as well as improving the user experience.</p>
<p><b> 9.    MOBILE-FRIENDLY</b></p>
<p><b> </b>   Since Mobile marketing is growing rapidly all over the world, blogs created should be useful for mobile users as well which will serve for future needs.</p>
<p>The main focus of the SEO content should be more informative and attractive which will be optimized for search as well as conversions and the next focus should be targeted towards the blog content which demonstrates how to use products and providing links relevant to the posts will automatically drive the users to spend more time in the blog.</p>
