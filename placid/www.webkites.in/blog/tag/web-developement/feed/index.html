				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Real World connected over the Internet for communication and commercial purpose.Do you know the difference and importance between http vs https ? .I have been working at a <a title="Web Designing Company in Chennai" href="https://www.webkites.in/web-designing-company-in-chennai" target="_blank"><strong>web designing company in chennai</strong> </a>for the past 10 years . I will help you to make understanding for you. Both are Protocols which means a set of rules and regulations of transmitting data between electronic devices.</p>
<h2>How HTTP Works ?</h2>
<div id="attachment_748" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-example-website-image.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-748" alt="http example website image" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-example-website-image.png" width="500" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Example look of http Website</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">HTTP stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>.All your requests are easily traceable by hackers. Arun kumar is Retail Business owner. He wants a website so he requests <a href="https://www.webkites.in/contact-us">http://www.webkites.in/contact-us</a>  from the <a href="https://www.google.com/">search engine</a>  . Now the response will come from an unsecured registered server.In between responses anyone <strong>can steal information</strong> of arun kumar.</p>
<h2>How HTTPS Works ?</h2>
<div id="attachment_751" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-example-webiste-image1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-751" alt="https example webiste image" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-example-webiste-image1.png" width="500" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Example Look of HTTPS Website</p></div>
<p>HTTPS stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Secured Socket Layer</a></strong>. All your information is not traceable by hackers . If Arun kumar requests <a href="https://www.webkites.in/contact-us">https://www.webkites.in/contact-us</a> from <a href="https://www.google.com/">search engine</a> . In between anyone <strong>can’t steal information</strong> of arun kumar. It is more useful for arun kumar retail business and website development company owner.</p>
<h2>How to check your website having HTTP or HTTPS ?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-to-check-my-website-is-having-http-or-https.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-747" alt="how to check my website is having http or https" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-to-check-my-website-is-having-http-or-https.png" width="690" height="191" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">STEP 1 : Wait for Loading your Complete Website<br />
STEP 2 : Now you have copy your Address bar which is available at the top of the browser.<br />
STEP 3: Paste it on a Separate Notepad File .<br />
STEP 4: Now you can see Complete URL</p>
<p>Great I hope you understood the difference between http vs https. Here after when you search on google make sure that website is secured or not.If you have any doubts comment below we will answer quickly.</p>
