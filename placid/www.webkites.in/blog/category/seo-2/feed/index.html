				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)</b></p>
<p><b>            </b>Search Engine Optimization is an analytical, technical and creative process to increase the online visibility of a website through search engine results. It is a process of optimizing a website where users can easily search through search engines. To start with the SEO content we need to create an outline first based on our understanding of the article.</p>
<p><b> HOW TO WRITE AN SEO OPTIMIZED CONTENT</b></p>
<p><b>1.    KEYWORD RESEARCH</b></p>
<p>For better SEO content, we need to understand which keywords to be used in the Google search to see what kind of contents are currently in ranking. Keywords which are searched frequently will drive towards the competition for the premium position. It is always best to do research on keywords before the content is written.</p>
<p><b>2.     TECHNICAL NEEDS</b></p>
<p>To create optimized content, knowing a few things technically about how search engines like Google handle the pages will assist in building a strategy. A good understanding of how a blog should be structured will be more efficient in creating an optimized content.</p>
<p><b>3.    CONTENT-LENGTH</b></p>
<p><b>                 </b>Generally, longer content and articles are preferred by search engines, so that users can search easily. Longer content adds more value to the customers and also increases visibility.</p>
<p><b>4.    CHOOSING TITLE </b></p>
<p><b>            </b>The Title plays an important role in content.   Choosing the appropriate title related to the content is also an important factor to consider when a user searches using the search engine.</p>
<p><b>5.    ADDING LINKS</b></p>
<p>The Inclusion of External and Internal links adds more value to the content. Internal links refer to a post within the article and External links refer to a post outside the article referring to the authority websites like CNN, Wikipedia which helps the users to explore more on the particular topic which will create a positive impact to the users. Also, the URL of the content should have a focused keyword which will look more professional and likely to be shared more on the social media channels.</p>
<p><b>6.    VISUAL CONTENTS</b></p>
<p>Including images and videos will further attract the users and also the time spent by the users will also be increased on the site.</p>
<p><b> 7.    ADDING META DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>Meta Description is a quick summary of the article that is included below the title. Adding a Meta Description to the content helps the users to grasp easily about what the content is all about.</p>
<p><b> 8.    SOCIAL SHARING BUTTONS</b></p>
<p>Use of social sharing buttons provides users a platform to share our content thus increasing the brand exposure as well as improving the user experience.</p>
<p><b> 9.    MOBILE-FRIENDLY</b></p>
<p><b> </b>   Since Mobile marketing is growing rapidly all over the world, blogs created should be useful for mobile users as well which will serve for future needs.</p>
<p>The main focus of the SEO content should be more informative and attractive which will be optimized for search as well as conversions and the next focus should be targeted towards the blog content which demonstrates how to use products and providing links relevant to the posts will automatically drive the users to spend more time in the blog.</p>

<p><b>Lower Cost per Click:</b></p>
<p>When compared to remarketing on search engines than its lower cost on remarketing in Facebook per click. Because the lower cost is that Facebook traffic is less targeted than the search engine traffic. The Search engines normally work around pull marketing since the people has searched for your product to start with, but Facebook exposes new potential clients to your product (push marketing) since, really, Facebook users aren’t searching for your product or service right now.</p>

<p><b>Drive Higher Conversions:</b></p>
<p>It takes time to converting a first time visitors in to buyers. If your industry is competitive, users can browse multiple websites before they complete a purchase. Once they left your website, they can forget your name and you might be lost your sale. To avoid this, remarketing to website visitors, who left your website and again they see you on Facebook will be more recognizable and efficient to boosts your chances of them converting.</p>
<p>You can exclude users those who have completed a sale by simply creating a custom remarketing segment for users who visited your thank you page and then preventing them from seeing your campaign.</p>
<p><b>Social Proof:</b></p>
<p>When a person who purchases your products or uses your services and they think that a good experience then, they recommend your brand or business. It’s not about to limit your remarketing only to potential customers. Displaying ads to those who have already purchase from you, allows current customers to interact with potential customers.</p>
<p>Happy customers always share positive comments and engage with your content. This can improve positive impression of your brand and might have increases the conversions, also increases brand loyalty.</p>
<p>This can leads to generate more engagement and conversions among potential or existing customers.</p>
<p><b>Mailing List Integration:</b></p>
<p>You can remarketing through mailing lists. You have to create a custom audience and import the mailing list. After that Facebook matches it up with the profile attached to the email. This way you can market to users even those who not known you have a Facebook page.</p>

<p>It is a social network that allows users to discover and save ideas of the pictures, videos. And also share the images and videos by own or from other boards. It is like other social media channels, can help create brand awareness and possibly facilitate website leads, but we still believe that, for most businesses, search engines can provide better ROI and direct conversion of visitors to customers. People can either upload pictures from their computer or pin things they find on the web using the Pinterest bookmarklet. It using posts that are called Pins.</p>

<p><b>Post regularly and at the right time</b></p>
<p>Analysis by Tailwind noted that “by posting to Instagram daily will grow followers four times faster than posting less than once a week”. So post daily at the right time. The best time is to post in the morning, lunch time or after work in the Monday to Friday basis. Most of the people don’t active in Instagram during working hours. According to your customers, active time post your content in that time.</p>
<p><b>Have a great bio and profile</b></p>
<p>Your profile is the backbone of your presence on Instagram. And one of the keys to increasing your followers. Who will click the follow button a profile that’s unclear, incomplete?</p>
<p>Your profile is made up of the name, username, website ad bio.</p>
<p><b>Name:</b></p>
<p>Up to 30 characters, and included in the Instagram search, so you may wish to include a keyword.</p>
<p><b>Username:</b></p>
<p>Make it consistent with your username on other social network channels to make it easy for followers on other platforms to find you on Instagram.</p>
<p><b>Website:</b></p>
<p>Here the place you can add a clickable link.</p>
<p><b>Bio:</b></p>
<p>Here, you can tell about you or else about your brand identity up to 150 characters and show new visitors why they should follow you.</p>
<p><b>Stick to a Schedule</b></p>
<p>It’s very important that your followers know when to expect a post from you. If you are active daily on Instagram then, post daily. Your audience will expect that regular post.</p>
<p>Update your account daily or otherwise, it will disappear for weeks.</p>
<p><b>Don’t be boring</b></p>
<p>If people are coming to your account for your photos then, Post what people like you but don’t post the same thing like sunsets, natures over and over. Post variety of photos what they like.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Targeting many keywords within a single page, that page should rank in a search engine is not an easy thing]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Targeting many keywords within a single page, that page should rank in a search engine is not an easy thing until we proceed with SEO friendly strategies. Yeah, but we can make it possible to rank many keywords on a single page by using SEO friendly strategies.</p>
<p>Let us discuss the How to rank for many Keywords within a single page,</p>
<p>The First thing is to go to Google AdWords, click on tools analysis and then click on keyword planner. Then click on search for keyword and ad group ideas and put your specific multiple keywords into this box. Select high search volume keywords according to your page. And then start to optimize your page by using these keywords which you had found. After, incorporate all these keywords into your title tag without over optimizing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Google-Keyword-Planner1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-621" alt="google-keyword-planner" src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Google-Keyword-Planner1.jpg" width="500" height="312" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mistake lot of people do is that, when they targeting multiple keywords for the single page, they use to do like this very, very common. It’s include repeat and repeated again, it’s not only bad for SEO but also it gives very low click through rate. So, include all keywords in the same title without over optimizing.</p>
<p>Next prepare for a description tag, which should include what people search for the query which related to your targeting keywords so, they can click through to this Meta description to your page. The Meta description should contain all of the keywords that you are targeting.</p>
<p>Next switch to the content of the page, in that, include your targeted keywords and make a content. Highlight all of your targeted keywords and use H<sub>2</sub> tags in the content paragraphs that is very important because Google concentrates on more at H<sub>2</sub> tags content in the paragraph tag.</p>
<p>These will form the subheadings for the paragraph and prepare the subheadings by using what, why, how like these words. And write the content which explains about the keywords. In that, you will include subheadings, right? As you write. Include some of the keywords into the content without over optimizing.</p>
<p>Now coming to the conclusion, you can target your multiple keywords on a single page and optimize your page as I discussed above. Optimization is great, as it will build the page&#8217;s rankings, while over-optimization is awful, as it can produce precisely the opposite results.</p>
