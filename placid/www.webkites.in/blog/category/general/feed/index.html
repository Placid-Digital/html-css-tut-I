				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Tag manager means Tag Management System created by Google. This system is created to manage HTML tags and JavaScript used for tracking the websites.</p>
<p>Google tag manager initial release was on 1st October 2012. Google tag manager version 2 was released on October 2014.</p>
<p>The Tag is nothing but the website code that help us to measure the website traffic and information about the visitor behavior, but adding too many tags makes your website slow.</p>
<p>Google tag manager helps the site owners to update the website quickly and easily.</p>
<p>With the help of Google tag manager user interface, you can update Ad Words and analytics instead of editing the code in the website.</p>
<p><strong>Why Tag Management system?</strong><br />
If your site is very slow and burdensome due to many tags, taking more time to implement new tags, Google Tag manager helps you in making your job easier.</p>
<p>Managing multiple tags is a tedious process but with the help of Google Tag Manager you can consolidate all your site tags in a single Admin panel. Now you can include that snippet code in your website.</p>
<p>One of the subsidiary feature in Google Tag manager is, Asynchronous Tag Loading.</p>
<p>Asynchronous tag loading is helpful in preventing the slow-loading tag from slowing down the rest of your website.</p>
<p><strong>How to set up Google Tag Manager?</strong><br />
1.	First visit the Google Tag manager <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/">https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/</a><br />
2.	Set up your account name<br />
3.	In second step set up your container name<br />
4.	You have to choose the container type that is the web, iOS or android<br />
5.	Accept the terms of the agreement<br />
6.	Finally, you will receive Google Tag manager code<br />
7.	Install the code on your website.</p>
<p>These are the steps to set up Google tag manager for the Web.</p>
<p>Next let us see about how to set up Google Tag manager for Mobile Apps.</p>
<p>We have to follow the same steps like Google Tag manager for web but instead of choosing web we have to implement Google Tag manager SDK for Android or iOS.</p>
<p>After the setup process, you can add tags such as Google ad words, Analytics and conversion tracking tags through Google Tag manager user interface.</p>
<p>By this way you can implement Google Tag Manager for your website.</p>
<p>If you wish to update your site with Google Tag management system, please mail us at <a href="mailto:support@webkites.in"> support@webkites.in</a>or visit  <a href="http://www.webkites.in"> www.webkites.in</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Columnist Aaron Slusky explains the new advertisers that what they have to know about the Google Adwords campaign settings.</p>
<p>In this blog, let us see about the five campaign settings that the new advertisers need to know about.</p>
<p>1. Stick with “SEARCH NETWORK ONLY”.<br />
2. Choose “ALL FEATURES”.<br />
3. Expand “LOCATION OPTIONS”.<br />
4. Expand “AD DELIVERY:AD ROTATION”.<br />
5. Understand Google’s “SEARCH PARTNERS” option.</p>
<p>Now let us see about the five campaign settings in detail.</p>
<p><strong style="color: red;">1. STICK WITH “SEARCH NETWORK ONLY”:</strong></p>
<p>When you are setting up your network campaign in Google Adwords it is best to avoid using the option “search network with display select” but Google says it is the best option to choose.</p>
<p>In Google “search network with display select” option if you are not using the right option to control your budgets it will spend your budget rapidly.</p>
<p>So it is better to choose “SEARCH NETWORK ONLY” option while setting up the campaign.</p>
<p><strong style="color: red;">2. CHOOSE “ALL FEATURES”:</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the search network campaign, you have to choose the type, i.e. standard or all features. If you are choosing standard you can use only limited options.</p>
<p>Standard option includes location, site links, call. You can use only this option but in the case of ALL FEATURES you can opt for call outs, reviews, app, structured snippets etc..</p>
<p>In all features you can also choose your ad scheduling, ad start date and end date etc.</p>
<p><strong style="color: red;">3. EXPAND “LOCATION OPTIONS”:</strong></p>
<p>Google does not display the location options in expanded form. Location settings can be expanded by clicking on the advanced option.</p>
<p>In location settings we can see the target and exclude option.</p>
<p>On target and exclude section there is some option to choose which type of audience we need for our business.<br />
We can use our audience based on their area, their interest in our products etc..</p>
<p><strong style="color: red;">4. EXPAND “AD DELIVERY:AD ROTATION”:</strong><br />
Google does not display expanded delivery option. In expanded form, we can see the following options.<br />
1. Optimize for clicks<br />
2. Optimize for conversions.<br />
3. Rotate evenly<br />
4. Rotate indefinitely</p>
<p>The default setting the Adwords account set is “optimize for clicks”. This setting helps in generating more clicks for your ads.</p>
<p>Before choosing the ad delivery and ad rotation setting be aware of your campaign settings and goals.</p>
<p><strong style="color: red;">5. UNDERSTAND GOOGLE’S “SEARCH PARTNERS” OPTION:</strong></p>
<p>In Google’s default setting search option is very important. By default, search partners are included in the search network campaigns, but if you want your ads to not show on search partners deselect the “include search partners” option.</p>
<p>These are the campaign settings new advertisers should know about Google Adwords.</p>
<p>If you wish to improve your business with Google adwords advertising, please mail us at <a href="mailto:support@webkites.in"> support@webkites.in</a>or visit  <a href="http://www.webkites.in"> www.webkites.in</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Columnist Pratik Dholakiya explains about the 3 Google patent and how it affects the search results. He also states that the three Google patents have immense effect on future search results.</p>
<p><strong style="color:red">SHORT NOTE ON PATENT:</strong></p>
<p>Patent also known as Copyright or permit. A Patent is a set of rights granted by a leader for the inventor of a product for an invention. </p>
<p>According to Google, a patent is not the important factor.  But by understanding the type of patents that Google arranged and the changes they made, you can understand the following terms:<br />
1.	Best practices.<br />
2.	Where SEO may be going in the future<br />
3.	How you can implement for long term SEO success.</p>
<p>Let us know about the three important patents that we should know in 2016. </p>
<p><strong style="color:red">PATENT 1-> ONSITE AND OFFSITE SEARCH RANKING RESULTS:</strong></p>
<p>It has been very long Google updated the page rank of websites. On December 2013 the page rank update was done before.</p>
<p>The announcement that Google page rank was being terminated caused a huge shock in the industry. But after this patent it seems to be that the page rank may be replaced or improved.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the page rank scoring system is from the range 0-10 and it is the symbol of trust for the searches.</p>
<p>Page rank is considered as a trust by the searchers or users this trust is seen in on-site content in the form of:<br />
1.	Link to the particular page from the other page within the same website.<br />
2.	Semantic search in relation to the search queries.</p>
<p>Off-site content is seen in the form of:<br />
1.	Number of external links to a page or a website from other related sites or pages.<br />
2.	Number of times the page or site ranked for a specific search query.</p>
<p>So concentrate on the content that users trust is one of the main factors that need to be concentrated on 2016.</p>
<p><strong style="color:red">PATENT 2-> STRUCTURED DATA USAGE IN SEARCH RESULT DEDUPLICATION:</strong></p>
<p>Google needs to diminish duplicate content, but in any case it is a hard thing to do, mainly for eCommerce websites, which have a number of pages to index.</p>
<p>But now Google may find a solution to reduce the duplicate content with the help of schema markup  if you are unfamiliar with the term schema markup you can move with schema.org </p>
<p><strong style="color:red">PATENT 3-> ROLE OF RICH CONTENT IN ANSWERING QUERIES:</strong></p>
<p>Rich content includes images, videos, graphs and charts. Nowadays rich content increased because search intent is changed.</p>
<p>Users are looking for more comprehensive queries and search results.<br />
Rich content will play an important role in 2016. So it is important to update your website with rich content.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is presently smarter at comprehension queries that incorporate superlatives and times, and more complicated questions.</p>
<p>If you ask Google about the ingredients of Screwdriver, Google understands that you mean about alcohol not about the tool.</p>
<p>Google product Manager, Satyajeet Salgar said that nowadays Google understands queries we search in three ways:</p>
<p>	Superlative queries<br />
	Time-Based queries<br />
	Complicated queries</p>
<p><strong>SUPERLATIVE QUERIES:</strong><br />
Google now understands the superlative words such as coldest, oldest and so on.  So you can search queries in Google including the superlative words.</p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE:<br />
1.	Who is the oldest boy at this party?<br />
2.	Who is the richest man in America?<br />
These are the superlative queries which Google understands nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>TIME-BASED QUERIES:</strong><br />
Google understands the time you mention in your queries.</p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE:<br />
1.	What was the population of Tamil Nadu in 1950?<br />
2.	What song did A.R. Rahman recorded in 2011?<br />
 These are some of the time based queries Google answers nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>COMPLICATED QUERIES:</strong><br />
Google also understands the complicated queries and provide search results for the complicated queries.</p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE:<br />
Who was the US President when the Angels won the World series?<br />
The image below explains about the complicated queries and the search results provided by Google.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Google-search.jpg" alt="Google Search Gets Smarter" width="970" height="746" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-415" /></p>
<p><strong>GOOGLE TESTING SPLIT-VIEW INTERFACE IN MOBILE SEARCH RESULTS:</strong><br />
On November first week, Google tested a new method of showing multiple languages in the mobile search results. </p>
<p>Below gives an image that displays two tabs displaying one English result and one Hindi results in a single search results. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/google-search-2.png" alt="Google Testing split-view interface for mobile searches" width="575" height="674" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-417" /></p>
<p><strong>GOOGLE’S STOPWATCH AND TIMER SEARCH FEATURE:</strong><br />
Now Google introduced the stopwatch and timer feature in order to remind you when to switch off your oven and take out your cake how fast you are in typing your articles or blog with the new stopwatch and timer.</p>
<p>Google has a changed intuitive answer box for a search for [timer], [stopwatch] and varieties of them, for example, [set a timer for 10 minutes].</p>
<p>If you type Set a timer for 7 minutes in Google search, Google will start the timer. The screen shot of the timer is displayed below.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Google-new-timer.bmp" alt="Google Timer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-420" /></p>
<p>The image below is the stopwatch which is to calculate how fast you are in typing the articles or blog.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Google-new-search.bmp" alt="Google stopwatch" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-421" /></p>
<p>Users can also use both timer and Stopwatch simultaneously.  There is even a choice to have it beep like an alarm clock, by tapping on the speaker symbol.</p>
<p>These are the latest news in Google search results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>What is a website</b>?</p>
<p>Technically a website is defined as a collection of web pages. A website is basically created to impart the erudition about a product, service or a brand. In current times a website is need of the hour and is created by most service providers. A contemporary company cannot succeed without a proper website which upholds its inherent values. Even investing in other modes of marketing would not produce revolutionary results like as experienced after creation of a website. Hence more and more entrepreneurs are engaged in website possession.</p>
<p><b>Who creates a website</b>?</p>
<p>Although a website specifically belongs to a particular brand or service, still it is not the owner of the website which creates the website. The task of developing a website is mostly allotted to website developer who creates a visually delighting website, which would attract a huge audience. The website owners deploy these experts and are liable to pay a certain sum to them. These website developers are also responsible for hosting and domain functions.</p>
<p><b>Why a company needs a website</b>?</p>
<ul>
<li>In current scenario marketing is an essentiality. A brand or service cannot succeed without proper marketing and exposure strategies.</li>
<li>Moreover the consumer will also opt for that service which has high visibility in the market. In order to facilitate marketing most companies and organizations have resorted to online marketing in form of websites.</li>
<li>These websites not only attract the viewer’s attention but also impart highly crucial information about an organization. The websites will contain important facts about history, services and future plans of the company.</li>
<li>Hence it is highly essential for each organization to possess a website which will act as medium for others to know about the organization.</li>
<li>It has also been visualized that the audience browsing through the company’s website can serve as potential clients in near future.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Basic outline of a company’s website</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Besides having a website it is equally essential that the website should not be a mere collection of web pages and stale content. It should be capturing and informatory. The content should be grammatically correct and precise. A section of galleries containing the pictures can also be incorporated. This will allow the users to have a better glimpse of the company’s profile.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Final word</b></p>
<p>Websites have become a rage. Not only large enterprises but small business ventures have taken a fancy of websites and hence are splurging huge amounts for the creation of one. Websites have established that fact that virtual visibility is more significant than physical visibility. Moreover these websites have huge scope and capability to reach large audience; hence rarely a human being remains untouched by a website.</p>
