				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to spread your business brand using online banners? You may have confusion with what type of banner, What size I need to use in what platform, and how to spread it on online platforms. As a <a href="https://www.webkites.in/web-designing-company-in-chennai">web designing company in Chennai</a>, we have 10 years of experience in making online banners. Here we will clear your confusion with a common checklist for making any type of design and how to pick a platform to spread your designs.</p>
<h2>Before you Design</h2>
<p>If you are running a B2C ( Business to Customer ) , you will sell products or services. You have to know about your customers. Before your Design, you must build a customer avatar which is also called a <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/personas-why-and-how-you-should-use-them">persona </a>. Once you know about a customer you have to collect information about customer behavior, demographics, and interests in your mind. For Example ) If you want to know people&#8217;s interest on google, you can check <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/trendingsearches/daily?geo=IN">google trends</a> with the demographic locations.</p>
<h2>Apply your Design</h2>
<p>Now you recollect that customer information and take action with your design tools like photoshop, illustrator, and much more. Now you know your <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats">customers what devices are using </a>more. You can define width size for your online banner. You need to design mobile and web separate banners. Check design principles like balance, alignment, whitespace, and repetition. Once you complete your design you ask your unknown friend for review purposes. They will find mistakes easily without knowing design principles. To know more about design principles check the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-principles">standard designer community</a>.</p>
<h2>After your Design</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, you have to spread your design on different platforms based on your customer using platforms. Due to internet penetration, you have to go with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnichannel">omnichannel</a> approach for your business. For Example) If your customers are using an android phone they will surely use the play store. Now you can check the play store which app is trending and relevant to your customers. Generally, Social media Apps are trending all over the world. If you want you can check different social media banners dimensions from <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-image-sizes-guide/">social media research insight</a> using social media tools..</p>
<h2>Start Spreading</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I hope you are well cleared about online banners. Hereafter you can make your own decision for your organization or company brand to the people online. If you have any doubts feel free to ask us, we will respond to you. Don’t forget to share this article with your business friends using social media or SMS or word of mouth or any good way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Real World connected over the Internet for communication and commercial purpose.Do you know the difference and importance between http vs https ? .I have been working at a <a title="Web Designing Company in Chennai" href="https://www.webkites.in/web-designing-company-in-chennai" target="_blank"><strong>web designing company in chennai</strong> </a>for the past 10 years . I will help you to make understanding for you. Both are Protocols which means a set of rules and regulations of transmitting data between electronic devices.</p>
<h2>How HTTP Works ?</h2>
<div id="attachment_748" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-example-website-image.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-748" alt="http example website image" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-example-website-image.png" width="500" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Example look of http Website</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">HTTP stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>.All your requests are easily traceable by hackers. Arun kumar is Retail Business owner. He wants a website so he requests <a href="https://www.webkites.in/contact-us">http://www.webkites.in/contact-us</a>  from the <a href="https://www.google.com/">search engine</a>  . Now the response will come from an unsecured registered server.In between responses anyone <strong>can steal information</strong> of arun kumar.</p>
<h2>How HTTPS Works ?</h2>
<div id="attachment_751" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-example-webiste-image1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-751" alt="https example webiste image" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-example-webiste-image1.png" width="500" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Example Look of HTTPS Website</p></div>
<p>HTTPS stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Secured Socket Layer</a></strong>. All your information is not traceable by hackers . If Arun kumar requests <a href="https://www.webkites.in/contact-us">https://www.webkites.in/contact-us</a> from <a href="https://www.google.com/">search engine</a> . In between anyone <strong>can’t steal information</strong> of arun kumar. It is more useful for arun kumar retail business and website development company owner.</p>
<h2>How to check your website having HTTP or HTTPS ?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-to-check-my-website-is-having-http-or-https.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-747" alt="how to check my website is having http or https" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-to-check-my-website-is-having-http-or-https.png" width="690" height="191" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">STEP 1 : Wait for Loading your Complete Website<br />
STEP 2 : Now you have copy your Address bar which is available at the top of the browser.<br />
STEP 3: Paste it on a Separate Notepad File .<br />
STEP 4: Now you can see Complete URL</p>
<p>Great I hope you understood the difference between http vs https. Here after when you search on google make sure that website is secured or not.If you have any doubts comment below we will answer quickly.</p>

I will make you understand the difference between web 1.0 and web 2.0 and web 3.0. So that You predict web 4.0 also.</p>
<h2><strong>Web 1. 0</strong></h2>
<p>Right from the beginning of the World Wide Web. We used a website for information sharing. We used for connect information about the business. For Example, If you have One Own Hotel. Mostly Travellers or Rarely Local Peoples will Come to your Hotel. Before they visit the Store they can get to know about the pricing list and timings. This is One Way Communication. We can read the Data from the Web by making a simple static website.</p>
<h2><strong>Web 2. 0</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>Web Industry has Developed very well. Internet Users also Increases. Good user Interface Browsers an Search Engines. We used the website for Interaction purposes.Mostly Interaction started on Social Media Websites. This Two Way Communications. We can Read and Write the Data on the Web. Now you reading this blog also an example of web 2.0.</p>
<h2><strong>Web 3. 0</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Modern Web Industry has Developed Very Well. Internet users increase very well using various devices like Mobile, Desktop, Tablet, and Smart TV also. More User Generated Content only placed on Future Websites. For Example, the Famous Online Shopping Website does not have any Physical Store. Famous Online Delivery Website does not have any Hotel or Restaurant. This is Multi-way Communications. We can read and write data by the User itself.</p>
<p>Finally, We all came to know about Web 1.0 to 3.0. Now You are able to Predict Web 4.0 also. Understanding History is helpful for knowing the progress and improving your future. Thanks to everyone.Share with your Friends this blog. They also came to know about Web World.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people will be having confusion in web designing and web development. These both term are not same and it is different from one other. Web design means adding <strong>graphic design principles</strong> to the website or web page whereas web development means developing <strong>web applications.</strong></p>
<p>Web design is fully based on the <strong>creativity</strong> of the website designer. Web developer should know about the <strong>programming language.</strong> There may be various web developers. Some fond of  HTML some  fond of PHP.  It is very rare to find out the developers with all the programming skill.</p>
<p>Various areas of web design are interface design,user experience design,  graphic design etc.. A good web design should attract the user or customer at single view.Web design is the <strong>front-end</strong> of the website and Web development is the <strong>back-end</strong> of the website.</p>
<p>Web  designing is focused on  <strong>look and feel</strong> of a web pages or website whereas  web development means work  done in <strong>inner part</strong> of the website. Web designing is created using HTML, CSS etc..  Web development is done using  programming languages using PHP, C, Ruby etc..</p>
<p>There are certain principles for web designing  such as <strong>balance</strong>, <strong>contrast</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong> etc.. Web developers also known as <strong>programmers.</strong>  Web developers use more advanced and latest  technologies such as content management system(CMS) and Joomla to help the  website administrators to maintain and update the site easily.</p>
<p>Website is of two types namely <strong>Static</strong> and <strong>Dynamic</strong>. Static website is also known as <strong>flat page</strong> or <strong>stationary page</strong>. Static website <strong>cannot be updated</strong> by everyone. The one who have knowledge about web development alone can access this type of website. Dynamic websites contain <strong>complex code</strong> compared to static website. The content in the dynamic websites <strong>can be updated</strong> by the client-side as well as server-side scripting.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>MOBILE:</strong></p>
<p>While designing a landing page for mobile device viewport size should be kept in mind.It’s not important that the content should be large and there should be more images .The color and content on  the page should be catchy and it should be navigative.Landing page designed in the way that it should be accessible,fast,brief,legible and it should be called friendly.Some of the mobile landing page creator tools are Google sites, convrrt, Spark page,Atmio,Jaemobi.</p>
