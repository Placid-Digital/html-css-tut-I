				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Want to increase your sales on your website? 10 years ago we used a normal phone which has a button for communication purposes. These days most people are using <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/">mobile phones in India</a>. As a <strong><a href="https://www.webkites.in/web-development-company-in-chennai">web development company in Chennai</a></strong>, we solved many problems for business people to reach their customers online. When you complete this article it will help you to decide what type of chatbot is useful for your business.</p>
<h2>
<p dir="ltr">1) Button focused Chatbot</p>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the olden days, we used mobile phones which had buttons for voice calling and messaging purposes. If we want to ask any questions about the product or service from brands. They used an Interactive<a href="https://www.airtel.in/business/b2b/airtel-iq"> voice response (IVR) </a> System for solving customer problems. Nowadays It was transferred to chatbot which will show our website menus as option tour customers. If a customer chooses any of the menus in chat, we will set a response for those menus. It is called button focused chatbot. Once you get 100 or 1000 visitors to your website on a daily basis you can make a decision to choose a button-focused chatbot.</p>
<h2>
<p dir="ltr">2) Keyword Recognition focused Chatbot</p>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I visited a supermarket that has more variety of grocery products. I asked one salesperson where potatoes are for sale. He guided me to which row and rack stored vegetables. Here “potato” is a word that recognizes the human and replies relevant to that rack. When it comes to the computer, it recognizes the keyword and replies to the relevant webpage link to your customer. Once your website gets 100 to 1000 returning visitors to your website on a daily basis you can make a decision to keyword recognition-focused chatbot.</p>
<h2>
<p dir="ltr">3) Conversion focused Chatbot</p>
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">One month ago I bought groceries for my home with my wife&#8217;s grocery list in a nearby grocery shop. This month, I went to the same shop to buy groceries and used the same grocery list. Finally, it saved more time to get my groceries home. When it comes to the website, you need to ask the question “Can I repeat your old order which you made for the previous month? “. If they replied “yes”, We can proceed with your order for the existing customer. Once your website gets 100 to 1000 conversion which means sales of your products or service to your website on a daily basis you can make the decision to Conversion focused Chatbot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I hope you have understood the different types of chatbots for business. Now you can make a decision about which type of Chatbot suits your business. We explained the different situations of chatbot based on our research. Finally, If you are interested in sharing your example, you can feel free to ask your example and doubts about our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/webkites">social media</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Real World connected over the Internet for communication and commercial purpose.Do you know the difference and importance between http vs https ? .I have been working at a <a title="Web Designing Company in Chennai" href="https://www.webkites.in/web-designing-company-in-chennai" target="_blank"><strong>web designing company in chennai</strong> </a>for the past 10 years . I will help you to make understanding for you. Both are Protocols which means a set of rules and regulations of transmitting data between electronic devices.</p>
<h2>How HTTP Works ?</h2>
<div id="attachment_748" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-example-website-image.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-748" alt="http example website image" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/http-example-website-image.png" width="500" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Example look of http Website</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">HTTP stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>.All your requests are easily traceable by hackers. Arun kumar is Retail Business owner. He wants a website so he requests <a href="https://www.webkites.in/contact-us">http://www.webkites.in/contact-us</a>  from the <a href="https://www.google.com/">search engine</a>  . Now the response will come from an unsecured registered server.In between responses anyone <strong>can steal information</strong> of arun kumar.</p>
<h2>How HTTPS Works ?</h2>
<div id="attachment_751" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-example-webiste-image1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-751" alt="https example webiste image" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/https-example-webiste-image1.png" width="500" height="194" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Example Look of HTTPS Website</p></div>
<p>HTTPS stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Secured Socket Layer</a></strong>. All your information is not traceable by hackers . If Arun kumar requests <a href="https://www.webkites.in/contact-us">https://www.webkites.in/contact-us</a> from <a href="https://www.google.com/">search engine</a> . In between anyone <strong>can’t steal information</strong> of arun kumar. It is more useful for arun kumar retail business and website development company owner.</p>
<h2>How to check your website having HTTP or HTTPS ?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-to-check-my-website-is-having-http-or-https.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-747" alt="how to check my website is having http or https" src="https://www.webkites.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-to-check-my-website-is-having-http-or-https.png" width="690" height="191" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">STEP 1 : Wait for Loading your Complete Website<br />
STEP 2 : Now you have copy your Address bar which is available at the top of the browser.<br />
STEP 3: Paste it on a Separate Notepad File .<br />
STEP 4: Now you can see Complete URL</p>
<p>Great I hope you understood the difference between http vs https. Here after when you search on google make sure that website is secured or not.If you have any doubts comment below we will answer quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays in our Daily Internet Penetration is more when compared to 1991. Why I said 1991 means This time Only WWW &#8211; World Wide Web was found. <a title="first website in world" href="http://info.cern.ch/" target="_blank">First Website </a>in World. Every Ten year Web World Releasing Versions. I working for <strong><a title="Web Designing Company in Chennai" href="https://www.webkites.in/web-designing-company-in-chennai" target="_blank">web designing company in Chennai</a></strong> past 10 years. I will make you understand the difference between web 1.0 and web 2.0 and web 3.0. So that You predict web 4.0 also.</p>
<h2><strong>Web 1. 0</strong></h2>
<p>Right from the beginning of the World Wide Web. We used a website for information sharing. We used for connect information about the business. For Example, If you have One Own Hotel. Mostly Travellers or Rarely Local Peoples will Come to your Hotel. Before they visit the Store they can get to know about the pricing list and timings. This is One Way Communication. We can read the Data from the Web by making a simple static website.</p>
<h2><strong>Web 2. 0</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>Web Industry has Developed very well. Internet Users also Increases. Good user Interface Browsers an Search Engines. We used the website for Interaction purposes.Mostly Interaction started on Social Media Websites. This Two Way Communications. We can Read and Write the Data on the Web. Now you reading this blog also an example of web 2.0.</p>
<h2><strong>Web 3. 0</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Modern Web Industry has Developed Very Well. Internet users increase very well using various devices like Mobile, Desktop, Tablet, and Smart TV also. More User Generated Content only placed on Future Websites. For Example, the Famous Online Shopping Website does not have any Physical Store. Famous Online Delivery Website does not have any Hotel or Restaurant. This is Multi-way Communications. We can read and write data by the User itself.</p>
<p>Finally, We all came to know about Web 1.0 to 3.0. Now You are able to Predict Web 4.0 also. Understanding History is helpful for knowing the progress and improving your future. Thanks to everyone.Share with your Friends this blog. They also came to know about Web World.</p>
